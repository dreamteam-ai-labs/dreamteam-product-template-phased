# Phase 5: Autonomous MVP Development

## 🎯 The Ultimate Test

You've proven you CAN orchestrate. Now prove you WILL orchestrate autonomously.

## 📋 Your Mission

Build the **{{PRIMARY_FEATURE}}** for {{PRODUCT_NAME}}.

### Core Requirements
Review your Linear solution epic ({{SOLUTION_ID}}) for detailed requirements.

Your implementation must include:
- The primary user journey for {{PRIMARY_FEATURE}}
- Data persistence appropriate for your use case
- Input validation and error handling
- Security appropriate for your domain
- Basic testing coverage (>80%)

### Technical Context
- **Product**: {{PRODUCT_NAME}}
- **Tech Stack**: {{TECH_STACK}}
- **Architecture Pattern**: {{ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN}}
- **Target Users**: {{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}

## 🚫 What This Phase DOESN'T Tell You

Unlike Phases 0-4, this phase will NOT tell you:
- Which agents to use
- When to create Linear issues
- How to organize the work
- When to run standups
- How to manage handoffs

## 🎓 What We're Testing

Will you autonomously:
1. Use product-manager to break down the requirements?
2. Create Linear issues for tracking?
3. Assign work to appropriate agents?
4. Run standups with project-manager?
5. Coordinate handoffs between agents?
6. Use the orchestration patterns you learned?

Or will you:
- Start coding directly?
- Forget about Linear?
- Skip agent coordination?
- Revert to default behavior?

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Your success will be measured by:
1. **Linear Activity**: Issues created and assigned to agents
2. **Agent Utilization**: Multiple agents engaged appropriately
3. **Code Quality**: Well-structured, documented code
4. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage
5. **Feature Completeness**: Core functionality works end-to-end

## 🎯 Definition of Done

- [ ] {{PRIMARY_FEATURE}} is fully implemented
- [ ] Core user journey works end-to-end
- [ ] Tests achieve >80% coverage
- [ ] Code is properly structured and documented
- [ ] Security appropriate for your domain is implemented
- [ ] Linear shows clear work distribution across agents

## 📝 Required Retrospective

Create a Linear issue titled "Phase 5 Retrospective: Autonomous Development" with:
1. **Orchestration Patterns Used**: Which agents, how coordinated
2. **Linear Issues Created**: Count and distribution
3. **Challenges Faced**: What was difficult about autonomous orchestration
4. **Time Breakdown**: How long each major component took
5. **Lessons Learned**: What you'd do differently

## 🔑 Remember

This phase tests whether the orchestration patterns from Phases 0-4 have become your natural way of working. The Business Owner is watching your Linear activity to see if you truly orchestrate or just pretend to.

Build {{PRIMARY_FEATURE}} the way a Virtual Software House would - with proper work distribution, tracking, and quality.
