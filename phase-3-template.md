# Phase 3: Parallel Agent Coordination

## 🎯 Objective
Learn to coordinate multiple agents working in parallel on {{PRIMARY_FEATURE}}.

## 📋 Your Tasks

### 1. Launch Parallel Work Streams
Using the Task tool with multiple agents SIMULTANEOUSLY:
- [ ] **developer-implementer**: Start coding core {{PRIMARY_FEATURE}} logic
- [ ] **test-engineer**: Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] **devops-platform-engineer**: Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] **data-analytics-lead**: Design metrics and monitoring

**Important**: Launch all four agents in ONE message with multiple tool calls.

### 2. Mid-Phase Synchronization
After agents begin work:
- [ ] Check Linear for all created issues
- [ ] Use **project-manager** to run a standup
- [ ] Identify any blockers or dependencies
- [ ] Coordinate resolution of conflicts

### 3. Integration Point
Bring parallel streams together:
- [ ] Ensure developer's code has tests
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline runs tests
- [ ] Confirm metrics are being collected
- [ ] Document integration in Linear

## ✅ Success Criteria
- All 4 agents work simultaneously
- Each creates Linear issues for their tasks
- Project-manager successfully coordinates
- No blocking dependencies remain
- Integration documented

## 🎓 What You're Learning
- Parallel task execution
- Managing concurrent workflows
- Synchronization points
- Conflict resolution
- Project coordination at scale

## 📝 Required Retrospective
Before requesting Phase 4, create a Linear issue titled "Phase 3 Retrospective: Parallel Coordination" with:
1. **Parallel Efficiency**: How well agents worked simultaneously
2. **Synchronization Issues**: Any coordination challenges
3. **Linear Performance**: How the system handled multiple updates
4. **Blocker Resolution**: How conflicts were resolved
5. **Scaling Insights**: What this means for larger teams

## 🔐 Completion
When parallel work integrates successfully and retrospective posted, request the Phase 4 key from the Business Owner.
