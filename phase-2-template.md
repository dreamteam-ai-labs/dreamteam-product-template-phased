# Phase 2: Agent Handoffs

## 🎯 Objective
Learn to coordinate handoffs between agents for {{PRIMARY_FEATURE}} development.

## 📋 Your Tasks

### 1. Architecture Design Handoff
Using the Task tool sequentially:
- [ ] Ask **solution-architect** to review the user stories and create technical architecture
- [ ] Document architecture in a Linear issue
- [ ] Hand off architecture to **senior-code-reviewer** for review
- [ ] Incorporate feedback into final architecture

### 2. UX Design Flow
Continue the handoff chain:
- [ ] Ask **ux-ui-designer** to create user flow for {{PRIMARY_FEATURE}}
- [ ] Have them document flows in Linear
- [ ] Request **voice-of-customer** to review from user perspective
- [ ] Update designs based on feedback

### 3. Technical Validation
Complete the handoff sequence:
- [ ] Ask **test-engineer** to review architecture for testability
- [ ] Have them create test strategy document
- [ ] Get **security-compliance-lead** to review for security concerns
- [ ] Finalize technical approach

## ✅ Success Criteria
- At least 3 successful handoffs completed
- Each agent creates Linear issues for their work
- Clear communication between agents via Linear comments
- Final architecture and design documented
- All feedback incorporated

## 🎓 What You're Learning
- Sequential agent coordination
- Managing context between handoffs
- Ensuring work continuity
- Tracking multi-agent workflows in Linear
- Handling feedback loops

## 📝 Required Retrospective
Before requesting Phase 3, create a Linear issue titled "Phase 2 Retrospective: Agent Handoffs" with:
1. **Handoff Success**: Which transitions worked smoothly
2. **Communication Challenges**: Any context loss between agents
3. **Linear Tracking**: How well the issue system worked
4. **Agent Performance**: Which agents were most effective
5. **Process Improvements**: Suggestions for better handoffs

## 🔐 Completion
When all handoffs complete and retrospective posted, request the Phase 3 key from the Business Owner.
