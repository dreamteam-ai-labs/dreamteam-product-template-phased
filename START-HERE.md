# 🚀 DreamTeam Phased Development System

## Welcome to {{PRODUCT_TITLE}}!

This project uses a **phased development approach** where you unlock capabilities progressively.

## 🎯 Why Phased Development?

Each phase teaches critical skills:
- Phase 0: Linear/GitHub connectivity
- Phase 1: Single agent collaboration  
- Phase 2: Agent-to-agent handoffs
- Phase 3: Parallel coordination
- Phase 4: Full team orchestration
- Phase 5: Autonomous MVP development
- Phase 6: Working implementation

## 📋 Phase Progression

| Phase | Status | Agents | Focus |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|
| 0 | ✅ UNLOCKED | Claude Only | Foundation & Connectivity |
| 1 | 🔒 LOCKED | Product Manager | User Story Creation |
| 2 | 🔒 LOCKED | Multiple Agents | Sequential Handoffs |
| 3 | 🔒 LOCKED | 4+ Agents | Parallel Work |
| 4 | 🔒 LOCKED | All 16 Agents | Full Orchestration |
| 5 | 🔒 LOCKED | All Agents | MVP Development |
| 6 | 🔒 LOCKED | All Agents | Working Code |

## 🚦 Current Phase: 0

**Start here**: Read `phase-0-foundation.md`

## 🔓 How to Progress

1. Complete ALL requirements in current phase
2. Post completion evidence to Linear
3. Request unlock key from Business Owner:
   - "Phase 0 complete: [evidence]"
   - "Ready for Phase 1 key"
4. Unlock next phase:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/unlock-phase.sh 1 [provided-key]
   ```

## ⚠️ Important Rules

1. **No skipping** - Each phase builds on the previous
2. **Full completion required** - Partial credit doesn't unlock next phase
3. **Evidence-based** - Must show working Linear issues/GitHub sync
4. **One phase at a time** - Focus on current objectives
